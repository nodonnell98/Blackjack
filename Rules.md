### Objective

There are two aims in blackjack:
1. Get as close to 21 as possible but not over
2. Get a higher number than the dealer

If you beat the dealer you get your bet return, however if you don't or go **bust** (go over 21) then you lose your bet.

### Card values

In blackjack the values of certain cards aren't the same as what you may find in other games.
**Picture Cards** - All picture cards have a value of 10.
**Aces** - Aces have can have a value of either 1 or 11. 

``` bash
# Example 1
A jack and a 3 equals a hand total of 13

# Example 2
Holding a 4, 6 and Ace can have a hand total of either 11 or 21

```
