# Blackjack
A blackjack game created with html, css and javascript

I created this game to develop my skills with the fundamental web languages of html, css and javascript. It was also my first look
at using classes within javascript and at NodeJS.

In order to find the dependencies please read the package.json.

The rules are displayed in-game, to find them simply press Ctrl + Shift + J to open the console where they will be displayed.

To run this game, simply open terminal and type in 'http-server -o'. This will serve the game locally, then add /index.html to the address to play the game.
